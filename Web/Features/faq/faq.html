    <h2 class="md-title">How does this work?</h2>
    We read your <code>packages.config</code> file and recursively lookup up those packages and their dependencies on
    nuget.org. We then look at whether there are any <code>.NETStandard</code> dependencies. Since what was the base class
    library is now referenced via nuget, the majority of .NETStandard assemblies reference at least one package.

    <h2 class="md-title">Do you keep any uploaded information?</h2>
    <p>
        Yes, but in a non-identifying way. We keep track of which packages have not yet been ported to .NET Standard, and a
        count of how many times that package was referenced. We do not track the names of packages that were not recognised,
        as these would typically be from internal nuget feeds. <a href="https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/ICanHasDotnetCore/blob/master/Web/Features/Statistics/StatisticsRepository.cs">See exactly what we record</a>.

        We also use google analytics to track page views and time one site.
